### Hi there üëã

I'm [Dries](https://driesvints.com), open-source maintainer and one of the core team members of [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel) where I maintain the first-party libraries. I also do the weekly releases of all the first-party packages.

In my free time I've built and maintain various open-source projects of my own like:

- [Lemon Squeezy for Laravel](https://github.com/lmsqueezy/laravel) - A package to easily integrate your Laravel application with Lemon Squeezy
- [Blade UI Kit](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-ui-kit) - A set of renderless components to utilise in your Laravel Blade views
- [Blade Icons](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) - Easily use SVG icons in your Laravel Blade views
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles) - Start using dotfiles on your Mac
- [Laravel.io](https://github.com/laravelio/portal) - The Laravel community portal
- [VatCalculator](https://github.com/driesvints/vat-calculator) - Handle all the hard stuff related to EU MOSS tax/vat regulations

I also co-organise [monthly user group events](https://fullstackbelgium.be/) here in Belgium in the cities of Antwerp and Ghent. And I co-organise the [Full Stack Europe](https://fullstackeurope.com/) conference here in Antwerp.

Working on open-source is my great joy in life and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you. Thanks for visiting!

If you found anything that I built useful for you or your company, [consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/driesvints) ‚ù§Ô∏è
