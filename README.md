### Hi there üëã

I'm [Dries](https://driesvints.com), open-source maintainer and one of the core team members of [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel) where I work as a software engineer. I also do the weekly releases of all the first-party packages.

In my free time I've built and maintain various projects of my own like:

- [Eventy](https://eventy.io) - Start your own user group for free, RSVP to events, find speakers for your event, share your talks and slides.
- [Blade Icons](https://github.com/driesvints/blade-icons) - Easily use SVG icons in your Laravel Blade views
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles) - Start using dotfiles on your Mac
- [Laravel.io](https://github.com/laravelio/portal) - The Laravel community portal
- [VatCalculator](https://github.com/driesvints/vat-calculator) - Handle all the hard stuff related to EU MOSS tax/vat regulations

Working on open-source is my great joy in life and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you. Thanks for visiting!

If you found anything that I built useful for you or your company, [consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/driesvints) ‚ù§Ô∏è
